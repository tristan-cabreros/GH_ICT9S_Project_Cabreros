	<th><h1>March: Fire Prevention Month</h1></th>
	<tr>
		<td class=" text-dark">In the Philippines, March is observed as Fire Prevention Month. This is a nationwide campaign aimed at raising public awareness about fire safety and prevention.<br><br>

		The Fire Prevention Month was first observed in 1966 by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 115-A. The annual observance is anchored on the principle of "Ligtas na Pilipinas ating Kamtin, Bawat Pamilya ay Sanayin, Kaalaman sa Sunog ay Palawakin".<br><br>

		During this month, various activities are conducted by the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), local government units, and other concerned agencies to promote fire safety awareness. These activities include fire drills, fire safety seminars, fire prevention lectures, and information campaigns through different media platforms.<br><br>

		<img src="https://www.fireprotectionshop.co.uk/images/blog/5/fire-extinguisher-guide.png" height="300" width="860" class="rounded img-thumbnail"><br><br>The BFP also conducts inspections of buildings, homes, and establishments to check their compliance with fire safety standards. They also issue reminders and guidelines on fire safety measures that should be taken, such as the installation of smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and proper electrical wiring.<br><br>

		Fire Prevention Month is a reminder to everyone to take proactive steps to prevent fires and to ensure that they are prepared in case of emergencies. By following fire safety guidelines and being prepared, we can reduce the risk of fires and protect ourselves, our families, and our properties from harm.</td>
